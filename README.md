## Analysis scripts:

 * **circos** - Circos configuration and execution scripts
 * **Fst** - scripts for Fst calculations
 * **genomic_prediction** - genomic selection scripts
 * **gwas** - scripts for GEMMA
 * **hecaton** - scripts for copy number variant calling
 * **impute_filter** - Beagle and BCFtools scripts
 * **metrics** - LD, nucleotide diversity, PCA
 * **misc_scripts** - snpEff, extract gene features from SNPs
 * **variant_calling** - scripts for GATK variant calling pipeline

 * Gene features were extracted using https://github.com/jlboat/features_from_snps
 * QTL were isolated from the Sorghum QTL Atlas using https://github.com/jlboat/query_qtl_atlas
